# Bivariate associations in multilevel cross-classified latent class models for categorical data 

This is the code we used for the simulations in the paper "Bivariate associations in multilevel cross-classified latent class models". 
The code in this version is available for simulation reproducibility purposes only and is an incomplete version of the code necessary to compute BVA applying the Multilevel Latent Class models for cross-classified categorical data.

## Usage
To run the simulations launch the .R files, which recalls a C++ program. Be sure to have installed .R, and the R packages Rcpp, RcppEigen and
RcppArmadillo.
